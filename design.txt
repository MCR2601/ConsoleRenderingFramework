Console Rendering Framework Design document
============================================
v0.1
by Marc Reiterer


Goal:
	Create a Framework that allows the rendering of pixels inside the console

Features that are wanted:
- System that allows printing information into the console
-- only print changed pixels
-- 
-- (low priority) batching same colores together
- public methodes for creating geometric objects


this will not provide any structuring
this will only provide a framework for placing pixels on 
(no layouting, no layermanagement)

+ Screenmanager
	These classes are the link between the real console and the application that wants to render things
	currently planned:
		- MultiSplitScreenManager
			*) allows splitting screen in subscreens, where each are beeing used by Rendering Applications
			*) Rendering Applications only know the size of their workarea

		- FullScreenManager
			*) provides a Screen that thinks it is a full screen
			*) has no other special Move
		- ObjectScreenManager
			*) allows for using special Objects to be placed on the Screen
			*) the Screen manages the rendering of the object automatically
			*) the objects have following information:
				+ positioninginformation of the object
				+ array of pixel information (parts may be null to allow only partly override specific characters like only background or forground)
				+ Size
